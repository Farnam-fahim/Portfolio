          <p>This portfolio is a general illustration of my skills, projects and experiences in this short lifetime in the most coordinate way with a little bit of HTML,CSS3 and JavaScript that I learned in college for about 2 months. All of this have been made by myself including the user experiance and the UI, which also the whole thing is a responsive, doesn't matter the size of your device it works perfectly fine on any device.</p>

        <h1 id="about"><strong>About me</strong></h1>
        <p>Hello, everyone. I am Farnam an Iranian guy who is mostly in love with foods. I also love playing video games and
        I take them very seriously cause I play competetively; although I have not won any prize but I am trying my best.</p>
        <br>
        <p>So basically my life started when I went to live in another country "Malaysia" when I was 11 years old.I lived their
        for 3 years and then return back to my home country to continue my study, so I can pursue my goals and go to the country
        that I really love as a successful person, which was Canada. After I got graduated from high school I applied for SFU,
        one of the best uiversities in Canada, as Engineer. I got my aceptance and successfully came to Vancouver, Canada.</p>
        <br>
        <p>In this time that I was studying Engineering I had to make one of the hardest decisions in my life. I was stuck in
        a dilemma of being an Engineer or a Programmer. After researching for month I made my decision and chose to be a Programmer.
        So I transfered to ITD college which IT is one of their specialities. This was the time that I understood that my love is not 
        only for foods and games but also programming; because I always wanted to know how do people creat these joyful games.However
        making games has a different field of study but the concept is hidden in heart of ptogramming.</p>
